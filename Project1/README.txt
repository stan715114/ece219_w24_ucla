Instructions:
● Codes are seperated into two parts; Part1_Q1_Q9.ipynb and Part2_Q10_Q13.ipynb
● Open with Google Colab (preferred) or jupyter notebook with environment set up
● Please run every problem one by one from beginning to end
● Refer to ECE219_Project1_Report.pdf for more details.
● Questions are answered below each code block
● Note that Part1_Q1_Q9.ipynb was implement on Google Colab while Part2_Q10_Q13 was on Jupyter Notebook. Please be awared of that if any issues come up.
● Gridsearch function for optimal parameters is time-consuming (i.e. it takes 40 mins to run optimization in Q5 and 2 hours in Q8).
